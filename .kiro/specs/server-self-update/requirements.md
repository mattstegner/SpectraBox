# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the SpectraBox server to update its own software directly from the web interface. Users will be able to check for updates, view version information, and trigger automatic updates through a new "Server" tab in the Settings page. The system will compare local version numbers against GitHub releases and perform seamless updates with minimal user intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a SpectraBox administrator, I want to view the current server version in the web interface, so that I can track which version is currently running.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the Settings page THEN the system SHALL display a "Server" tab alongside existing tabs
2. WHEN the user clicks on the "Server" tab THEN the system SHALL display the current application version number
3. WHEN the system reads the version information THEN it SHALL retrieve the version from a Version.txt file in the application root
4. IF the Version.txt file does not exist THEN the system SHALL display "Version Unknown" or a similar fallback message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a SpectraBox administrator, I want to check for available updates from the web interface, so that I can determine if a newer version is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on the Server tab THEN the system SHALL display an "Update" button
2. WHEN the user clicks the "Update" button THEN the system SHALL check GitHub for the latest revision number
3. WHEN checking for updates THEN the system SHALL compare the GitHub revision against the local version number
4. WHEN the comparison is complete THEN the system SHALL display whether an update is available or if the system is current
5. IF the GitHub API is unreachable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a SpectraBox administrator, I want the system to automatically update when a newer version is available, so that I can keep the server current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a newer version is detected AND the user confirms the update THEN the system SHALL initiate the update process
2. WHEN the update process begins THEN the system SHALL suspend the running server gracefully
3. WHEN the server is suspended THEN the system SHALL execute the update mechanism (spectrabox-kiosk-install.sh)
4. WHEN the update is complete THEN the system SHALL optionally reboot the server
5. WHEN the update process encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt to restore service
6. IF the update fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging to the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a SpectraBox administrator, I want the update process to be as simple and reliable as possible, so that I can trust the system to update without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing an update THEN the system SHALL use the existing spectrabox-kiosk-install.sh script as the primary update mechanism
2. WHEN the update process runs THEN it SHALL replace all local server code with the latest version
3. WHEN the update is triggered THEN the system SHALL provide clear status updates to the user interface
4. WHEN the update completes successfully THEN the system SHALL verify the new version is running
5. IF the update process is interrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt to restore the previous working state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a SpectraBox user, I want to be notified during the update process, so that I understand the system is temporarily unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an update is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a clear status message indicating the update is running
2. WHEN the server is suspended for updates THEN existing connections SHALL receive appropriate notifications
3. WHEN the update is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect users to the updated interface
4. IF the update takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators or status updates
5. WHEN the update fails THEN the system SHALL clearly communicate the failure and next steps to the user
