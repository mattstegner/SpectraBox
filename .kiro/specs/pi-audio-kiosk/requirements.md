# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project creates a cross-platform Node.js web application designed to run on a Raspberry Pi in kiosk mode. The system provides a web interface for audio device selection and management, with persistent configuration storage. The application must work seamlessly across macOS (development) and Raspberry Pi OS/Debian Linux (deployment) environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a lightweight Node.js server framework, so that I can efficiently serve web content on resource-constrained Raspberry Pi hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use Express.js or similar lightweight framework
2. WHEN running on Raspberry Pi THEN the system SHALL consume minimal system resources
3. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL serve static HTML/JavaScript files
4. WHEN accessed via browser THEN the system SHALL load the main HTML interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see available audio devices on my system, so that I can select the correct audio input device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web page loads THEN the system SHALL enumerate all available audio input devices
2. WHEN audio devices are detected THEN the system SHALL display them in a user-selectable list
3. WHEN running on macOS THEN the system SHALL use macOS-specific audio device APIs
4. WHEN running on Linux/Raspberry Pi OS THEN the system SHALL use Linux-specific audio device APIs
5. WHEN no audio devices are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my audio device selection to be remembered, so that I don't have to reconfigure it every time the application starts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an audio device THEN the system SHALL save this preference to disk
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load previously saved preferences
3. WHEN preferences are saved THEN the system SHALL use JSON format for human readability
4. WHEN preferences file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it with default values
5. WHEN preferences are corrupted THEN the system SHALL fall back to defaults and recreate the file

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to work on both macOS and Linux, so that I can develop locally and deploy to Raspberry Pi without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL detect the current operating system
2. WHEN running on macOS THEN the system SHALL use macOS-compatible file paths and API calls
3. WHEN running on Linux THEN the system SHALL use Linux-compatible file paths and API calls
4. WHEN accessing system resources THEN the system SHALL use cross-platform Node.js modules where possible
5. WHEN OS-specific functionality is needed THEN the system SHALL implement platform-specific handlers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate existing HTML/JavaScript code, so that I can preserve the current spectrum analyzer functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL copy existing HTML/JavaScript from the external repository
2. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL serve the spectrum analyzer HTML as the main interface
3. WHEN integrating existing code THEN the system SHALL NOT modify the original external repository
4. WHEN the web interface loads THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing spectrum analyzer functionality
5. WHEN copying files THEN the system SHALL place them in an appropriate location within the new codebase

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to run in kiosk mode on Raspberry Pi, so that it provides a dedicated audio analysis interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed to Raspberry Pi THEN the system SHALL be optimized for kiosk mode operation
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL be accessible via web browser on the local network
3. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL start automatically on system boot
4. WHEN accessed remotely THEN the system SHALL serve the interface to network clients
5. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL operate efficiently on Raspberry Pi hardware
